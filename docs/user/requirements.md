## User Creation

Besides the usual account sign up found in most websites, users may be registered as throwaways for purposes of testing the app- such users are called Temporary Users in this document. Temporary Users do not require entering any information to sign up- but expire after logout (be it by manually logging out or end of browser session) or 3 days, and cannot edit their profile. Temporary Users can be made permanent at any time by updating their setting with the necessary [information](#update-settings).
