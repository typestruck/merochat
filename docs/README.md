# Software Requirements Specification

Author: [@easafe](https://github.com/easafe)

## Overview

MeroChat is a self moderated, random chat application for platonic interactions.

Self moderation: privileges (e.g. sending images, audio, etc) need to be unlocked by acquiring enough karma. Random, as in random chat, means that chat partners are suggested by the app. Such suggestions may be skipped, but not filtered in any way (such as by age, gender, location etc). Finally, MeroChat is not a dating or hookup app -- the focus is amicable chatting.

## Requirements

Requirements (definitions, business logic and screens) for MeroChat are grouped as follows:

1.  [User](user/requirements.md)

    User profiles and general management of accounts on the application

2.  [IM](im/requirements.md)

    The chat flow on the application

3.  [Karma](karma/requirements.md)

    Privileges, karma scoring
