MeroChat is a friendly random chat!

### Random

* User profiles start off as auto generated, i.e., name, bio, avatar, etc are picked by the app

* Users to chat with are suggested by the app - besides skipping suggestions, it is not possible to search or filter potential new chats

* Users may be invited to participate in novel chat experiments or features, similarly to April's Fool Reddit gimmicks

### Friendly

* Self moderation by Karma: ~~fake internet points~~ a numeric score of how much a given user is trusted by the community

* Features (e.g., profile visibility, sending audio or pictures, etc) are unlocked by gaining Karma

* Privacy: users may choose to temporarily suspend, delete or restrict their account at any given time

* Zero tolerance for bots, spammers or perverts

A note on naming: mero is the Guarani word for melon.
